# Should we propose distribution agnostic defaults?
# Obviously no-one would use it for FLL_DISTRO_NAME
# But perhaps having an agnostic name for e.g
# FLL_MOUNTPOINT may offer the lazyiest approach

# specify distribution name
FLL_DISTRO_NAME="Kanotix"

# Propose FLL_IMAGE_DIR and FLL_IMAGE_NAME to match
# knoppix_dir and knoppix_name cheatcodes?
# Optionally combine them here to FLL_IMAGE?
# Secondly, should this and MOUNTPOINT below be arrays?
# where is the compressed image located (from the media root)
FLL_IMAGE_LOCATION="KNOPPIX/KNOPPIX"

# specify the mountpoint for the compressed file system
FLL_MOUNTPOINT="/KNOPPIX"

# As a match to the above though only relevant to kanotix fromiso
FLL_MEDIA_DIR="KNOPPIX"
FLL_MEDIA_NAME="KNOPPIX.ISO"
FLL_MEDIA_MOUNTPOINT="/isosrc"

# specify default user name on a single user system

# Propose FLL_DISTRO_STATUS instead as clearer?
# system status (installed|live)
FLL_DISTRO_MODE="installed"

# Propose FLL_HARDWARE_DETECT and FLL_SINGLE_USER switches instead
# Installer can turn these on|off to replicate below?
# current live cd would have both on
# install type (debian|beginner|live)
FLL_INSTALL_TYPE="debian"

# where is the default X wallpaper located
